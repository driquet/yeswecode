# Genetically Modified Rabbits

One crazy scientist just sent you a genetically modified rabbit (GMR), named **Poncho**.
Its DNA has been extensively modified, and we fear that Poncho may take over the world!
Indeed, Poncho is able to reproduce at light speed, following these rules:

- An adult GMR is asexual and is able to reproduce on its own.
- At the beginning of each month, an adult GMR has a litter of 7 babies.
- A baby becomes an adult after 3 months.
- A GMR NEVER DIES.

Imagine what will happen over the next few months. The table below counts the number of GMR just after the beginning of each month.

| Month    | # of adults | # of newborn babies | # of one-month-old babies | # of two-month-old babies |
|---------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 1 | 1 | 7 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 1 | 7 | 7 | 0 |
| 3 | 1 | 7 | 7 | 7 |
| 4 | 8 | 56 | 7 | 7 |
| 5 | 15 | 105 | 56 | 7 |

A GMR is huge (even babies), it occupies a one-square meter space (how convenient). The area of France and Germany is respectively 551,695 km² and 357,592 km².
In this challenge, your task is to determine the number of months it would take for the genetically modified rabbit (GMR) population to cover both France and Germany.
Additionally, you'll calculate the total number of GMRs present at that point.

The flag is the multiplication of these two values.
