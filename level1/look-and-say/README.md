# Look-and-say
The look-and-say sequence is a mathematical sequence where each term describes the previous term in spoken language.
For example:

- 1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
- 11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
- 21 is read off as "one 2, one 1", or 1211.

The look-and-say sequence begins as follows: 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, ...

Instead of developing the sequence, we want to try to reduce a term, i.e. going from `1211` to `21`.

Reduce 42 times the term in the input file to find the flag.
